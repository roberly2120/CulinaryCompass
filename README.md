Culinary Compass is an AI-generated recipe application built using React and the OpenAI API. 
The purpose of this app is to offer recipes commonly eaten in a randomly genreated country to provide the user with a new recipe to try from around the globe. It is, like most things, a work in progress, and it has been interesting to learn about the limitations of OpenAI in this particular application.
