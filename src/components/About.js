            <p>I don't know about you, but I thrive on a new cooking challenge. If I have a free day, one of my favorite things is to find a recipe I've never made before and take a crack at it. The purpose of this site is to click one button and discover a new recipe to try. No extra work searching for something to cook...just click the button and go for it!</p>
